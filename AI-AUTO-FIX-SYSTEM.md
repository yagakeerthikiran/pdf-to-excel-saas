## ⚙️ **CONFIGURATION VARIABLES**

### **Core Auto-Fix Settings**
```bash
AUTO_FIX_ENABLED=true              # Enable/disable the auto-fix system
MONITORING_INTERVAL=60             # How often to check for issues (seconds)
ERROR_THRESHOLD=10                 # Number of errors before triggering auto-fix
```

### **Integration Requirements**
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_xxxxx      # GitHub token for creating fix PRs
JWT_SECRET_KEY=32_char_secret      # For secure communication with Claude API
ENCRYPTION_KEY=32_char_key         # For encrypting sensitive data in logs
```

### **Optional Enhancement**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=xxx         # Enhanced error tracking
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=xxx        # User behavior analytics
```

## 🔄 **AUTO-FIX WORKFLOW**

### **Phase 1: Detection** 🔍
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: System monitors:
   - API response times and error rates
   - PDF conversion success/failure rates
   - User session abandonments
   - Stripe payment failures
   - Authentication issues

2. **Threshold Triggers**: When errors exceed threshold:
   - Collect relevant logs and error patterns
   - Gather user context and reproduction steps
   - Prepare diagnostic data package

### **Phase 2: Analysis** 🧠
3. **AI Diagnosis**: Claude analyzes:
   - Error logs and stack traces
   - User interaction patterns
   - Recent code changes
   - System resource usage
   - Third-party service status

4. **Root Cause Identification**: Determines:
   - Whether issue is code-related or infrastructure
   - Affected components and services
   - Potential impact scope
   - Recommended fix approach

### **Phase 3: Solution** 🛠️
5. **Fix Generation**: Claude creates:
   - Code fixes with proper error handling
   - Configuration updates
   - Database migration scripts (if needed)
   - Updated tests and documentation

6. **Staging Deployment**: Automatically:
   - Creates feature branch with fix
   - Deploys to staging environment
   - Runs comprehensive test suite
   - Validates fix resolves the issue

### **Phase 4: Approval** ✅
7. **Human Review**: System sends you:
   - **Issue Summary**: What went wrong and why
   - **Fix Description**: What changes were made
   - **Test Results**: Proof that fix works in staging
   - **Risk Assessment**: Potential side effects
   - **Approval Request**: Deploy to production?

8. **One-Click Deployment**: Upon your approval:
   - Merges fix branch to main
   - Deploys to production via GitHub Actions
   - Monitors deployment success
   - Confirms issue resolution

## 📊 **MONITORING DASHBOARD**

The system provides a real-time dashboard showing:

### **System Health** 💚
- ✅ Active monitoring status
- 📈 Error rates and trends
- 🕒 Last auto-fix deployment
- 🎯 Success rate of auto-fixes

### **Current Issues** 🚨
- 🔥 Critical issues requiring immediate attention  
- ⚠️ Warnings and potential problems
- 📋 Queued fixes awaiting approval
- ✅ Recently resolved issues

### **User Impact** 👥
- 📊 Affected user count per issue
- 💰 Revenue impact of outages
- 😊 Customer satisfaction scores
- 📈 Conversion rate changes

---

## 🛡️ **SECURITY & SAFEGUARDS**

### **Safety Mechanisms** 🔒
- **Staging-First**: All fixes tested in staging before production
- **Human Approval**: Critical fixes require your explicit approval
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant rollback if new issues detected
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 auto-fixes per hour to prevent cascading issues

### **Data Protection** 🛡️
- **Encrypted Logs**: All diagnostic data encrypted with ENCRYPTION_KEY
- **Limited Scope**: AI only accesses necessary logs and code
- **No Customer Data**: Personal user data never sent to Claude
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all auto-fix actions

## 🎯 **EXAMPLE SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: PDF Conversion Failures** 📄
**Detection**: 15 users report "conversion failed" in 5 minutes
**Analysis**: Claude finds memory leak in PDF processing
**Fix**: Adds proper memory cleanup and file size limits  
**Result**: Conversion success rate improves from 85% to 99%

### **Scenario 2: Stripe Payment Issues** 💳
**Detection**: 8 payment failures with same error code
**Analysis**: Claude discovers expired webhook endpoint
**Fix**: Updates webhook URL and adds retry logic
**Result**: Payment success rate restored to 100%

### **Scenario 3: Performance Degradation** ⚡
**Detection**: API response times increase 300%
**Analysis**: Claude identifies database query performance issue
**Fix**: Adds database indexes and query optimization
**Result**: Response times return to normal < 200ms
